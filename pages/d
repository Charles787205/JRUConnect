1. Lists:
   Mutable: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified after creation.
   Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements, allowing for indexing and slicing.
   Syntax: Defined using square brackets `[ ]`.
   Use Cases: Lists are suitable for situations where you need a collection of items that can be changed, such as maintaining a dynamic list of elements, implementing stacks, queues, etc.
   Implications: Due to their mutability, lists provide flexibility but may require more memory and processing overhead compared to tuples.

2. Tuples:
   Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
   Ordered: Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements.
   Syntax: Defined using parentheses `( )`.
   Use Cases: Tuples are useful when you want to create a collection of items that should remain constant throughout the program's execution, such as representing coordinates, returning multiple values from a function, or as keys in dictionaries.
   Implications: Immutable nature makes tuples faster and more memoryefficient than lists. They are particularly beneficial in scenarios where data integrity and performance are critical.

3. Dictionaries:
   Mutable: Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for the addition, modification, and deletion of key-value pairs.
   Unordered: Unlike lists and tuples, dictionaries are unordered collections.
   Syntax: Defined using curly braces `{ }` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`.
   Use Cases: Dictionaries are ideal for storing data in a key-value pair format, providing efficient lookups based on keys. They are commonly used for mapping unique identifiers to values, caching, and representing structured data.
   Implications: While dictionaries offer fast lookups and insertion, they may consume more memory compared to lists and tuples due to the overhead of maintaining key-value associations.
